This project aims to solve the **cold start** problem for Insider customers, mainly e-commerce platforms and online retailers.

Cold start is a fundamental problem for recommender systems. Recommender engines suffer from being highly data driven decision makers, as healthy recommendations are not possible for new products with little or no historical data.

The smart product recommender focuses purely on recommending products without any historical data. By analyzing product images taken from a smartphone camera (garment and textile products) the smart recommender finds and displays products similar in appearance from Insider's customer databases.
