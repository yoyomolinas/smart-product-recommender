This is the senior design project for Koç University Computer Engineering Design Project course. We are co-operating with Insider. Insider helps marketers drive growth with their AI-powered Growth Management Platform. Our aim in this project is to solve the problem called Cold-Start. Both item-based and user-based collaborative filtering algorithms suffer from this problem. The problem definition is that when a new product is added to the recommendation system database, the system cannot recommend that item due to insufficient colloborative data. So, some time is required to make healthy recommendations until that item's rating values are settled. The way we are going to use to solve this problem is create and train a model that consists of combination of Convolutional Neural Network and K-Nearest-Neighbor clustering and use the item's images to find a similarity to make recommendations.
